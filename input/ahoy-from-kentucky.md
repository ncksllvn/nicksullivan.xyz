subtitle: My goals with this, remembering the times I tried it before, and reframing it from a blog into a "digital garden."

They say the first step is often the hardest, but that wasn‚Äôt always true for me - sometimes, that was the easy part. That does, however, seem to be the case with writing this post, because actually getting started with _it_ was a pretty daunting task.

So brace yourself, because this post is going to be very meta.

I only have one clearly defined goal for this blog, which is simply to _not_ delete it. That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôll forgive myself if I lose interest and let it float away into the digital Milky Way of the internet, just as long as it __hasn‚Äôt been deleted__.

I‚Äôve lost at least two blogs this way already.

I don‚Äôt remember which came first, but one was completely technical (I‚Äôm a software developer by trade) and totally meaningless to me on a personal level. I built it just so I could add it as a footnote on my resume. That is not a very interesting reason to build a blog. I didn‚Äôt actually _intentionally_ delete it, but its little space on the internet was carelessly overwritten on one sad day for that blog.

In the other blog, I encouraged myself to just write freely and not worry so much. Alas, I only ever wrote a single post, and that was on the same day I felt the inspiration to make the blog in the first place. Then, when I revisited that one lonely post about a year or so later, I didn‚Äôt like it at all, so I found my way to the account settings and deleted it. _So long, lame blog_ ‚úåüèª

A year from now (or possibly, a _week_ from now) I will probably not appreciate this post and others, but I hope future-me will honor the thoughts behind them by letting them continue to exist anyway.

_Future-me, if you are listening, __leave this blog alone__._

We often look back at ourselves in memories, old photos, or our creative works and feel embarrassed, while at the time, we were perfectly fine. I think an optimistic perspective might encourage us to celebrate that person, even if only in the sense that we are proud of our growth since then. I suppose then that my second goal for this blog is that as time passes, it can provide me with some perspective of self-growth as I read my old posts.

But with that said, it doesn‚Äôt bother me that I deleted those old blogs üòÅ

While thinking of how this site would be organized and who would visit, I struggled with reconciling the technical stuff I want to write with the personal stuff I‚Äôd like to share. __Does it make sense for both types of writing to live on the same website?__

It seemed to me that the natural way to structure the website would be for a visitor to be immediately presented with a fork in the road - go left to take the technical road, or go right to take the personal road. It was the most obvious organizational pattern, like the typical dichotomy of a person as a professional versus a person as a person.

However, now that I have thought more deeply about it, it is pretty unlikely that anyone is going to enjoy all of what I write into either group, and maybe it is more likely that a visitor will enjoy just some of each. Perhaps each individual post is its own island that has its own relationships with the other islands, and digital travelers island-hop across the site as they explore. Meanwhile, other travelers may enjoy one island and that‚Äôs all.

Island-hopping may be a bit of a stretch. A more accurate analogy might be that the website is a gathering (party, maybe) where conversations can span the whole spectrum of one‚Äôs life and not everyone connects with the topic of each particular conversation.

For instance, say you step into a conversation where two gentlemen are talking about their code. _‚ÄúWhoa, these guys are a couple of squares,‚Äù_ you think. So you take a sip of beer, take a peek at your phone, then turn your attention to the individual next to you. _‚ÄúEver go barefoot running?‚Äù_ you ask politely. _‚ÄúWhy yes, all the time. Let‚Äôs talk about that,‚Äù_ they respond.

And that‚Äôs pretty much what this blog will be like.

I‚Äôve referred to this website several times now as a blog, but I would actually like to reframe it into a _digital garden_. I learned about this idea from [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) and [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), but [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) does a wonderful job describing it as well -

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory ‚Äì notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

To me, a digital garden is distinct from a blog in that it asks the author to let go of the pressure that comes from releasing content into the public. Instead, it focuses more on appreciating the process (rather than only the product itself), being patient while embracing the contributions of a wide spectrum of thoughts and ideas. That is my attitude as I have worked on this so far.

In this digital garden, I hope to touch on these subjects:

- Running (barefoot, primarily)
- Coding
- Family
- Experiences
- Music
- Politics (dare I?)
- Random things
- Rambling with no clear objective

I‚Äôm excited to write about these things. Eventually, this now-tiny site could be an interesting place to wonder.

Soon, there will definitely be a technical post about making this, and of course a post that answers the question I‚Äôve been asked more often than any other question in my life - _You run barefoot? Seriously?_

Thanks for reading my first post.

Cheers üçª
